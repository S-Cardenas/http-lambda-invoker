# http-lambda-invoker

A Docker image to invoke lambda functions via http.

[SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) is a great framework for developing a few lambda functions, but it's challenging to fit into existing development workflows based on docker-compose. http-lambda-invoker allows invoking lambda functions via http in a mixed serverless and container local development environment.

examples and stuff to come!
